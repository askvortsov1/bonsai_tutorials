# Todo List: Hello World!

Welcome to the `todo_list` Bonsai tutorial!
Over several chapters, you'll build a full-stack todo list application entirely in OCaml.
We'll focus on how to design and write Bonsai components, and how to use Bonsai's tools and primitives.
However, chapter 2 will walk you through implementing the RPC protocol and backend implementation.

In this chapter, we'll cover:

- How to run the tutorial code
- What the starter code does

## Running the Tutorial

You'll write code in the `workbench/todo_list` directory, but terminal commands will be run
from the root of this "tutorials" library.

As you work through this tutorial, you should frequently build and re-run the application
to see your changes come to life. 

Before you start, install all dependencies:

```sh
$ opam install workbench/todo_list
```

Then, when you've made changes, you can run:

```sh
$ dune build
$ ./_build/default/workbench/todo_list/server/bin/main.exe
```

to build and run your code. Then, all you need to do is go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser!

At this point, all you should see is a "Hello world! message. Let's discuss how it works.

## Starter Code Structure

Most chapters of this tutorial will have you writing code.
Since we've given you a bunch of starter code, we wanted to explain it before we jump in.
If you've worked on full-stack OCaml projects before, you probably already know most of this.

We'll start by explaining the starter code's directory structure:

- `todo_list.opam`, `dune-project`: these declare that our workbench is a self-contained project, allowing it to be built.
- `common`: this directory will eventually contain type definitions and RPC protocol specifications that will be shared by the frontend and backend.
- `server`: this directory contains backend code, split into 2 parts:
  - `src`: this is the source code for our backend, exposed as a `Command`
  - `bin`: this wraps the server from `src` into a binary. That's what we run to launch the site.
- `client`: this is where we'll build our Bonsai web app.

## The Backend

The goal of these tutorials is to teach you how to write Bonsai. However, frontend web UIs generally don't exist in a vacuum.
There's often a backend server that we want to communicate with; in our case, through RPC calls.
Also, web apps need to be served from somewhere, although that could be done as static files.
For an example of that, see the `snake_game` tutorial.

This project's server will have 2 jobs:

1. Serving content. This includes:
   1. HTML for the todo page, and for a "404 not found" page
   2. Static JS/CSS files, which Bonsai will compile from our frontend code.
2. Handling RPC requests from the frontend.

We'll implement (2) in chapter 2, and focus on (1) for now.
